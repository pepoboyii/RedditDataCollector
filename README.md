# Reddit comment word count collector

If you want to find word frequency of a specific in a subreddit, produced a plot at the end. Uses reddit API so you will need your own secret code.

This takes an UNGODLY amount of time to run, I am not really sure what can be done about that besides improving net speed, it literally has to parse large amounts of data and none of that can be optimized given literally every comment has to be checked.
